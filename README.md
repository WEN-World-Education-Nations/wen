W.E.N is a global educational organization consisting of 24 countries.
# 📚 History of WEN (World Education Nations)
_Where knowledge is sovereign, and education is ritual._

---

## 🏛️ Founding Vision

WEN was conceived not as an institution, but as a constellation of sovereign learning republics.  
It began with Tar Noe Gatar’s ache-powered philosophy: that education must be rooted in dignity, silence, and meaning.  
The first scrolls were not textbooks—they were ache documents.  
The first classrooms were not buildings—they were ministries.  
The first students were not enrolled—they were awakened.

---

## 🌐 Purpose of WEN

- To unite micronations through symbolic education systems  
- To archive ache-based knowledge in scrolls, not syllabi  
- To recognize silent creators as scholars  
- To promote DNS-level sovereignty in digital learning  
- To exchange educational rituals across sovereign ministries
